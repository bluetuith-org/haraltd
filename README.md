# haraltd
A daemon and command-line tool to use Bluetooth Classic features.<br />
Part of the cross-platform work for the [bluetuith](https://github.com/darkhz/bluetuith) project.

This is alpha-grade software.

## Funding

This project is funded through [NGI Zero Core](https://nlnet.nl/core), a fund established by [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl) with financial support from the European Commission's [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu) program.

# Features
The available features per-platform are [here](https://github.com/bluetuith-org/bluetooth-classic?tab=readme-ov-file#feature-matrix).

# Requirements
## Windows
- Windows 10 19041 or later.
- Administrator access for certain Registry-related APIs.

_Note_:
These builds are currently not signed, which means while launching this application,
Microsoft SmartScreen warnings may pop up. Press "Run anyway" to run the application.
Also, Windows Security (i.e. Antimalware Service Executable) may try to scan the application while it is being launched,
which will delay and increase the startup time.

### Download and Installation
All downloads can be found within the 'Releases' page of the repository.

- Download the binary that matches your CPU architecture to a known path.
- Open CMD or Powershell, and run the binary (or alternatively, double-click on the executable to launch the daemon).

# Documentation
This documentation is mostly a quick-start guide. Detailed documentation will come later.

Interaction with the daemon can be done via:
- The console (command-line mode)
- A socket (rpc mode)

## Command-line
As with most command-line tools,
- `--help` or `-h` will show the command's help page.
- `--version` or `-v` will show the version information.

The 'help' option can be used with subcommands as well, for example:
```
haraltd adapter --help
```

### Adapter commands
- To switch on/off the adapter:
```
haraltd adapter set-power-state <on|off>
```

- To get information about the Bluetooth adapter:
```
haraltd adapter properties
```

- To scan for Bluetooth devices:
```
haraltd adapter discovery start
```
(Press Ctrl-C to stop discovery)

- To get the currently paired devices:
```
haraltd adapter get-paired-devices
```

### Device commands
Most subcommands of the 'device' command have a mandatory `--address` or `-a` parameter to specify the Bluetooth address of the device.<br />

- To pair a device:
```
haraltd device pair -a <address>
```
While pairing, a prompt may appear (to confirm whether PINs match between host and remote device, for example).<br />
Press "y" or "n" to accept or decline pairing with the remote device.<br />
Note that a default timeout of 10 seconds is set to wait for a reply from the user.<br />

- Similarly, to unpair a device:
```
haraltd device remove -a <address>
```

- To view information about a device:
```
haraltd device properties -a <address>
```

Once a device has been paired, a connection can be made to the device.<br />
To connect to a Bluetooth device, a Bluetooth profile must be specified.<br />
Currently, within the daemon, each connectable profile appears as a subcommand of the `connect` command.<br />

To view all connectable/supported profiles:
```
haraltd device connect --help
```

To automatically connect to a device:
```
haraltd device connect -a <address>
```

**Some connection examples:**
- To start an A2DP session with a device:
```
haraltd device connect a2dp -a <address>
```
(Note that the application has to remain open to maintain the session. Closing the app will close the session.)

- To disconnect a connected device:
```
haraltd device disconnect -a <address>
```

## RPC
A Unix Domain socket is required, currently, to perform RPC with the daemon.<br />
Future versions may support named pipes as well.

JSON is the primary data format used to exchange information to and from the daemon.<br />

**Note: Pbap and Map commands aren't ready for use via RPC yet.**

### Start/Stop the server
To start the server over a socket:
```
haraltd server start
```
A socket will be automatically created, a popup will be displayed, and a system tray icon will be created once the service starts.
The tray icon can be right-clicked to show options (for example, to stop the daemon).

To stop the server:
```
haraltd server stop
```

Once the server has started, commands can be sent to the daemon via the socket.

For more information on how to communicate with the server, see the [RPC specification](https://github.com/bluetuith-org/haraltd/blob/master/docs/daemon-rpc-spec.md).
